# Data_Visualization-challenge

## Pymaceuticals Inc. Mouse Study

This project focuses on the analysis of mouse study data using Python and popular data analysis libraries. The analysis utilizes a combination of data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques.

## Skills and Tools Utilized

* ### Data Manipulation:

* Merging dataframes using pd.merge()
* Filtering rows using DataFrame.loc[]
* Grouping and aggregation with DataFrame.groupby() and DataFrame.agg()
* Calculation of summary statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM)

* ### Statistical Analysis:

* Calculation of correlation coefficients using st.pearsonr()
* Linear regression analysis with linregress()

* ### Data Visualization:

* Creation of bar charts using pandas and numpy libraries
* Generation of line plots using the matplotlib library

* ### Project Outputs and Visualizations

The analysis produces the following outputs and visualizations:

* Preview of the joined data table
* Summary statistics table showcasing tumor volume by drug regimen
* Bar plot illustrating the total number of mouse timepoints for each drug regimen
* Final tumor volume of each mouse across specific treatment regimens
* Identification of potential outliers
* Line plot displaying the tumor volume over time for a single mouse treated with Capomulin
* Scatter plot and linear regression analysis depicting the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen

## Conclusion

These scripts demonstrate the power and flexibility of Python for data analysis tasks. By leveraging Python's data manipulation capabilities, statistical analysis functions, and data visualization libraries, valuable insights can be extracted from complex datasets. Python's file handling, data manipulation, conditional statements, loops, and data structures make it a versatile tool for efficient and effective data analysis.
